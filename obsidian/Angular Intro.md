Yes, youâ€™re correct! Now that your backend API is set up, you can start building the frontend with Angular. The frontend will interact with your backend API to send requests based on user actions, and update the UI based on the responses.

Here are some steps you might follow to create your Angular frontend:

1. **Install Angular CLI**: If you havenâ€™t already, youâ€™ll need to install the Angular CLI globally on your machine using npm (which is included with Node.js):Â `npm install -g @angular/cli`
    
2. **Create a new Angular project**: You can create a new Angular project by running the command:Â `ng new my-app`
    
3. **Create a service**: Youâ€™ll likely need an Angular service to interact with your API. You can generate a service using Angular CLI:Â `ng generate service light`
    
4. **Implement the service**: In your service, youâ€™ll use Angularâ€™sÂ `HttpClient`Â to send HTTP requests to your API. You might have methods likeÂ `getLightState(id: number)`Â andÂ `setLightState(id: number, state: LightState)`.
    
5. **Create components**: Youâ€™ll need to create components for your applicationâ€™s UI. For example, you might have aÂ `LightComponent`Â that displays the state of a light and allows the user to control it.
    
6. **Implement the components**: In your components, youâ€™ll use the methods from your service to interact with your API. For example, when a button is clicked in yourÂ `LightComponent`, you might callÂ `this.lightService.setLightState(this.lightId, newState)`.
    
7. **Start the development server**: You can start the Angular development server withÂ `ng serve`. By default, this will start a server atÂ `http://localhost:4200/`.
    

Remember, this is just a high-level overview. Building a frontend with Angular involves many more details, but I hope this gives you a good starting point!
