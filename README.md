This was a project to learn Angular and use it with C#; 

I used the basic Philips Hue API but realized that it can't handle the requirements I have for my plans. (Mostly because of the rate limitation)

So I keep pHueControl as this basic learning project, but I'm working on pHueEntertainment that uses the Entertainment API.

How to use:

Get your bridge's IP address and a user with permissions (check https://developers.meethue.com/develop/get-started-2/ for info) 

Enter said info on localhost:4200 in your browser, select a light to control, color and state and hit Submit to see the light change!

Get Light State just gets the entire json information for the selected light.
